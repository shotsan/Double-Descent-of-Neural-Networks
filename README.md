# Universal Function Approximation

We know neural networks have this amazing characteristic: Function approximation.
However, it is hard to find the optimal neurons in the architecture. 


## Deep double descent

First observed, by [Preetham et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02292), also reported at [Open AI](https://openai.com/research/deep-double-descent)



# Notebook
This [Notebook](neural_networks.ipynb) has code to define any function, and visualize the approximation of Neural Networks and
also observe descent phenomenon of neural networks.
